In this project there is one program.

The aim of this project is to classify 5 different types of pokemon!

1- Bulbasaur
2- Charmander
3- Mewtwo
4- Pikachu
5- Squirtle

How it works? First, we implement a small VGG network architecture which can be found in
NN_Architecture, we then write two python scripts train.py & classify.py, to train the NN
run the first command in Commands.txt file, and to test on a specific image run the second
command in Commands.txt file.

My model reached 95.53% training accuracy and 90.2% validation accuracy, which means it's
slightly overfitting :)
