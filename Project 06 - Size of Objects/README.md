In this project there is one program.

The aim of this project to implement on object detector then calculate the width and the
height of each object.

How it works? We place a coin in the left most of an image where we know the width of this
coin (width = 0.955in) then we calculate the pixels per inch ratio and calculate by it the 
sizes of the other objects

To run this program, type the first/second/third command to run the program on a 
pre-saved image.
