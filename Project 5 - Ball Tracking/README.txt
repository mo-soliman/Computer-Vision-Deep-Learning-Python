In this project there is one program.

The aim of this project to implement a Green Ball Tracking, where the input is a pre-recorded
video OR a live stream video (Laptop camera) and the output is tracking the movement of the
ball and drawing a line following the movement of its centroid.

How it works? It detects the contour of the greenish ball and its centroid, then draw 
a circle on the outline of the ball, and saves the centroid in a buffer, then draw a line
between each two points(centroids) in the buffer which gives the tracking effect of the ball
movement.

To fire this program type the first command to run the program on a pre-recorded video
OR type the second command to run the program on the laptop camera.
