In this project there is one program.

The aim of this project to implement an automatic test grader (Bubble Sheet), where the 
input is the exam paper, and the output is your grade and which are the correct and wrong
answers.
How it works? It detects the contours of the circles then count the number of NonZero pixles
in each circle, the circle with the highest number means it the selected option by the
student, finally we check his option with a saved dictionary with the correct answer.


To fire this program just type the first command in the Commands.txt file 
after cd-ing into the project directory
