In this project there are two program (One for training the neural network and the other
for testing it)

The aim of this project is to build a neural network that correctly classifies 
whether a given image contains a dog or a cat.

My neural network is fully connected 3072-768-384-2 where 3072 is the input dimension.
75% of the data was dedicated for training and the other 25% for testing.
