In this project there is one program.

The aim of this project to implement a document scanner, where it scans for example a
receipt, detect its outline, then apply perspective transform to see the receipt upright,
finally apply thresholding to see the black & white paper effect.


To run this program just type the first or the second command in the Commands.txt file 
after cd-ing into the project directory. (2 different examples on 2 images)
